# AudioMan
This is the infamous audio manager that I've used in wake tech projects for the last 2 years \o/

Right now, it's a bunch of spaghetti and I'll need to fix a lot of things eventually, but I do intend this to be the new and improved AudioMan meant for future projects.

You'll find semi-readable documentation above each function, explaining what it does.

This was originally based on Bracky's audio manager tutorial, which you can find here: https://youtu.be/6OT43pvUyfY
